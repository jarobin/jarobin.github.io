## Welcome!

I am an evolutionary geneticist using whole genome sequence data to study the impacts of small population size and inbreeding, particularly in the contexts of conservation and genetic health. 

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Institute for Human Genetics at the University of California San Francisco. In 2017, I completed my PhD in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of California Los Angeles. 

See the [Research](https://jarobinsonresearch.com/research/) page for more information about my past and ongoing projects.
