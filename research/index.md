### Island Foxes

Populations that are small and isolated face an elevated risk of extinction, partly due to genetic factors. These genetic factors include reduced fitness due to inbreeding depression and the accumulation of deleterious mutations, and reduced potential for adaptation due to the loss of genetic diversity over time. Though experiments in the lab have repeatedly demonstrated that small and isolated populations are doomed to mutation accumulation and, ultimately, extinction, it remains unclear whether this process poses a significant risk to populations in the wild. In the 1990s, several studies revealed that island foxes (Urocyon littoralis) on California's Channel Islands harbor exceptionally low levels of genetic diversity, indicating a long history of small population size and isolation on the islands. In one particular population on San Nicolas Island, the foxes were genetically indistinguishable from one another. This level of genetic monomorphism has not been observed in any other wild population, and begs the question of how island foxes have persisted for thousands of years without showing obvious physical symptoms of genetic deterioration. Through collaboration with other geneticists and experts on skeletal morphology, I have attempted to resolve this apparent paradox. In two publications [1, 2], we describe the results and implications of whole genome sequence analyses, morphological examinations, and simulations of island fox evolution to understand the unique history of island foxes and how their story reveals the conditions in which small populations in isolation may thrive for thousands of generations.
